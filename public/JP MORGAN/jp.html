JPMorgan Chase & Co. is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in New York City and incorporated in Delaware.<br>
It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization (as of 2023).<br>
As the largest of the Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board<br>
Its size and scale has led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal "Fortress Balance Sheet"[6][7] and liquidity reserves.<br>
The firm is headquartered on 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building in 2025.<br>
<br>
<br>
The firm's early history can be traced to 1799, with the founding of Chase Manhattan Company.<br>
In 1871, J.P. Morgan & Co. was founded by J. P. Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall Street as a national purveyor of commercial, investment, and private banking services.<br>
The present company was formed as the two predecessor firms merged in 2000, creating a diversified holding entity.<br>
It is a major provider of investment banking services in the Bulge Bracket, through corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, sales and trading, and public offerings.<br>
Their private banking franchise and asset management division are among the world's largest in terms of total assets.<br>
Its retail banking and credit card offerings are provided via the Chase brand in the U.S. and United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
With US$3.67 trillion in total assets, JPMorgan Chase is the fifth-largest banking institution in the world.<br>
The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.<br>
It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue.<br>
It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines.<br>
The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty.<br>
Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.<br>
