<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nikhil CS.I am a btech cse undergrad from NIT andhrapradesh which is a newly established 
  univerity under mhrd .It is one of the youngest and fastest growing institute of India. 
  I am proficient in many skills and have a moderate grasp on multiple languages such as python and c++.
  this website is a fun take on a webiste protfolio with some basic html skills i have picked up 
  along the way which i wanted to showcase
</p>
<p>
  So far the 2 websites i have created which are my two best pieces of work are linked below along with one other website
  which i am proud to have created in a css battle competition which took place in my college fest.
  Since i am not familiar with formatting yet thus the work appears slightly below par as of now 
  but the sky is the limit and i have nowhere to go but up so i shall strive to continue improving with the passing time 
  while being able to easily adapt to new updates in the versions of html.
